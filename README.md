# Space-Observer-Api

I was recently looking for a good API to make an application with to properly show which celestial bodies will be visible the following night and try as I might I could not find one for the passive terrestrial observer. As such, I made my own. I currently only have functionality for my own area and for objects that are visible by eye only but I will add additional areas and magnitudes of objects in the future.

This API is currently deployed to https://space-observer-api.herokuapp.com/ if you would like to check it out or utilize it. Currently only for one area though I'll change that as soon as I finish my frontend.

If you would like to contribute open a pull request or let me know I'm always happy to have the feedback.
